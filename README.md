Exploring the dynamical consequences of local substructure on species population trajectories 

## Where are we now?  

We have three food webs covered thus far: **Tuesday Lake** (combined 1984, 1986), **Little Rock Lake**, and the **Atlantic Shelf** food web.

For Tuesday Lake we have phytoplankton and zooplankton timeseries, for Little Rock we have zooplankton, and all species for the Shelf. For each species with a time series we have assessed: 
1. Trophic Position
2. In degree (Generality)
3. Out degree (Vulnerability)
4. Vertex Betweenness
5. Eigenvector Centrality
6. Google Pagerank
7. Subgraph Centrality
8. Module Number
9. Module Participation
10. Module connectivity 
11. Module Role

For each time series we have: 
1. number of observations
2. mean density
3. standard deviation of density 
4. coefficient of variation of density
